# 🎧 Audiophile e-commerce website

This is my solution for a [guru level challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx)
from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## 📝 Challenge

Build a multi-page e-commerce website as close to a provided Figma design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
- Shipping always adds $50 to the order
- VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
